#### Summary
Fairly interesting but overly "show-off" and unclear on the actual implementation of meshing. The technology appears to work well but centers on building a game-specific database. Some technical choices and limitations raise questions.


#### Key Insights
- The system is segmented around compute, network, and storage, possibly avoiding the use of a traditional DB by leveraging node memory to reduce latency.

- Heavy emphasis on database architecture tailored for gaming use cases.

- Uses WASM for compute; demo only handles ~1,000 balls, hinting at possible scalability limits.

- Unity integration could be worth exploring for practical application insights.
