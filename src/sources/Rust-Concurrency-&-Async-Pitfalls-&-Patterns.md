# Rust Concurrency & Async Pitfalls and Patterns

#### Summary
A series of practical articles and guides highlighting the difficulties and gotchas of writing concurrent and asynchronous code in Rust. The content spans from low-level atomic operations to async/await quirks, with illustrative examples and debugging techniques. Despite version gaps, the resources remain valuable for grasping core concepts.

#### Key Insights
- Rust’s `async/await` introduces subtle ownership and lifetime traps—especially around `Pin`, `Unpin`, and stackless futures.

- Shared state and thread-safe operations require deep understanding of atomics, memory ordering, and data races.

- The lack of proper async trait support (pre-1.75) led to complex workarounds, now mitigated by more recent Rust features.

- Effective debugging of async code often requires understanding how executors poll futures and manage task wakeups.
